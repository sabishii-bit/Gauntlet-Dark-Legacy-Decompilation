A work-in-progress decompilation of **Gauntlet Dark Legacy** for the Nintendo GameCube, built with
[decomp-toolkit](https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit) and the
[dtk-template](https://github.com/encounter/dtk-template) project structure.

This repository does **not** contain any game assets or assembly whatsoever. An existing copy of the game is required.

It builds `main.dol`:

| Version    | Game ID  | SHA-1                                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Rev 1 (USA) | `GUNE5D` | `7cba77aa496eb0fc5ffec60efd9680aa9635d679` |

Dependencies
============

Windows
--------

On Windows, it's **highly recommended** to use native tooling. WSL or msys2 are **not** required.  
When running under WSL, [objdiff](#diffing) is unable to get filesystem notifications for automatic rebuilds.

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and add it to `%PATH%`.
- Download [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) and add it to `%PATH%`.
  - Quick install via pip: `pip install ninja`

macOS / Linux
--------------

- Install [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages).

[wibo](https://github.com/decompals/wibo), a minimal 32-bit Windows binary wrapper, will be automatically downloaded and used to run the CodeWarrior compilers.

All other tools (compilers, objdiff-cli, sjiswrap, etc.) are downloaded automatically during the build.

Building
========

- Clone the repository:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/sabishii-bit/Gauntlet-Dark-Legacy-Decompilation.git
  ```

- Copy your game's disc image into `orig/GUNE5D/`.
  - Supported formats: ISO (GCM), RVZ, WIA, WBFS, CISO, NFS, GCZ, TGC
  - Alternatively, place extracted files directly (e.g. `orig/GUNE5D/sys/main.dol`).
  - After the initial build, the disc image can be deleted to save space (objects are extracted to the filesystem).

- Configure:

  ```sh
  python configure.py
  ```

- Build:

  ```sh
  ninja
  ```

The build is verified against [config/GUNE5D/build.sha1](config/GUNE5D/build.sha1), and also
produces `build/GUNE5D/main.retail.dol`, byte-identical to the retail disc image.

Diffing
=======

Once the initial build succeeds, an `objdiff.json` should exist in the project root.

Download the latest release from [encounter/objdiff](https://github.com/encounter/objdiff). Under project settings, set `Project directory`. The configuration should be loaded automatically.

Select an object from the left sidebar to begin diffing. Changes to the project will rebuild automatically: changes to source files, headers, `configure.py`, `splits.txt` or `symbols.txt`.

Contributing
============

Contributions that improve the accuracy of the decompilation are welcome. The
project's helper scripts live in [`tools/gdl/`](tools/gdl/), and each script
supports `--help`.

Before submitting a change, rebuild the project, inspect the affected object in
objdiff, and make sure the linked DOL still passes the configured hash check.
Please keep commits focused and avoid mixing unrelated cleanup with decompilation
work.

To link non-matching code for testing (final hash will not match):

```sh
python configure.py --non-matching
ninja
```

This mode links raw compiler output. It deliberately bypasses Frank, WebFrank,
P6Frank, and every other retail-target/hash-dependent object rewrite so edited
source remains usable as a normal mod build.

To print decompilation progress:

```sh
python configure.py progress
```

### Matching work queues

Use the low-match queue for semantic and structural reconstruction work:

```sh
python tools/gdl/lowmatch.py --refresh
python tools/gdl/lowmatch.py --sort impact --min-size 200 --parked skip
```

It excludes already linked translation units and, by default, lists functions
at or below 50% fuzzy match. `--sort lowest` emphasizes the least reconstructed
functions; `--sort impact` emphasizes their estimated remaining byte gap. Use
`tools/gdl/nearmiss.py` separately when deliberately closing already high-match
functions. Both queues honor the project's maintained parked-function cap list.

Xbox debug symbols
==================

[research/xbox_symbols/](research/xbox_symbols/) contains ~3,500 type definitions (structs, enums,
unions — with exact field offsets and sizes) extracted from leaked PDB debug symbols of the **Xbox**
version of the game. Because Midway shared the game codebase across platforms, these layouts carry
over to the GameCube binary.

> [!NOTE]
> **Verified:** decompiling `AtreeFindNode`/`AtreeMatch` in the GUNE5D DOL shows every field offset,
> struct size, and array stride matching the PDB definitions of `atree`, `anode`, `anodeinfo`,
> `atreelist`, and `atreeinfo` exactly (11/11 offsets checked — e.g. `atree.nanodes` @ 0x3C,
> `sizeof(anode)` = 0x28, `atreeinfo.offset` @ 0x20).
